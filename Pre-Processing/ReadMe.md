Lung segmentation using U-net


Wrote a jupyter notebook file  (lung-segmentation-v1.ipynb ) to test the U-net on “ COVID-19 Radiography database (CXR)” 

( lung-segmentation-v1.ipynb is changed from the code in kaggle, be aware of the path of test images when running the jupyter notebook. )
Alternatively, use “lung-segmentation-v2.ipynb” to show Unet training and produce the images in Figure 2 of the paper
